Using Playwright MCP, open the browser to http://localhost:5174/ in headed mode.

Explore the demo store app:
1. Search for "Headphones" using the search bar
2. Add "Wireless Headphones" to the cart
3. Add "Coffee Maker" to the cart
4. Click the Cart button to view the cart
5. Increase the quantity of Wireless Headphones to 2
6. Verify the cart total updates correctly

After exploring, generate a Playwright E2E test file for this "add to cart" flow.
The test should:
- Use accessible selectors (getByRole, getByLabel, getByText)
- Include meaningful assertions after each action
- Follow Playwright best practices
- Be saved as tests/cart.spec.ts
